## Inspiration

Our motivation behind Tortoise Investing was to educate users about the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and its potential impact on their investments.

## What It Does

Tortoise Investing allows users to explore the outcomes of employing Dollar Cost Averaging with different stock tickers. Users can input the stock of their choice, specify their contribution amount, select the frequency of contributions (weekly, monthly, bi-weekly), and determine the investment duration in years. The platform generates insightful charts illustrating the growth of their assets and contributions over time. Additionally, users receive a quick summary detailing profit/loss and the overall gain percentage.

## How We Built It

We utilized Next.js as the primary framework for Tortoise Investing, leveraging its flexibility and efficiency. To gather comprehensive and free historical ticker data, we successfully implemented web scraping techniques on Yahoo Finance. The informative charts are powered by Chart.js, providing an engaging and visual representation of the investment journey.

## What We Learned

The development of Tortoise Investing provided us with valuable learning experiences. We introduced ourselves to Next.js for web development, and honed our skills in presenting complex financial information in an intuitive and accessible manner.
